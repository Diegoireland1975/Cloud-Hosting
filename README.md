# Cloud-Hosting
This is a Fictional cloud hosting Plattform.
This is my first project using BEM and I used a completely different approach.
Instead to floow the mockup from the top to bottom, I created every single components first and then put all together.
Honestly I found this approach more difficult.
Technologies used:
Bem methodology, Grid and Flexbox for the Layout, JS for the hamburger menu and AOS librabry to add a smooth animation on scroll
